# BHR
*Burden Heritability Regression* (BHR) is a method to estimate the heritability explained by mutational burden in each gene. BHR is described in detail in [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.06.22277335v1). 

`BHR` is a utility implemented in R for estimating burden heritability and derived quantities, including gene set enrichments and genetic correlations.
