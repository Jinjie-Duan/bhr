*Burden Heritability Regression* (BHR) is a method to estimate the heritability explained by mutational burden in each gene, as well as gene-set enrichments and burden genetic correlations. BHR is described in detail in [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.06.22277335v1). 

**Setting up `BHR` on your machine**

This repository contains the `BHR` code. To download into an R session, run:
`devtools::install_github("ajaynadig/bhr")`

**Documentation**

For documentation and an example analysis workflow, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/ajaynadig/bhr/wiki).

We have also published other detailed scripts in the [`example`](https://github.com/ajaynadig/bhr/tree/master/example) folder, including scripts for generating gene-level summary statistics from variant-level summary statistics, scripts for running `BHR`, and scripts for generating the figures in the manuscript. Scripts for running the simulations in the manuscript are in the `MATLAB` folder.
